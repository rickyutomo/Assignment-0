| The author of tidyr, Hadley Wickham, discusses his philosophy of
| tidy data in his 'Tidy Data' paper:

| This paper should be required reading for anyone who works with
| data, but it's not required in order to complete this lesson.

| Tidy data is formatted in a standard way that facilitates
| exploration and analysis and works seamlessly with other tidy data
| tools. Specifically, tidy data satisfies three conditions:
| 
| 1) Each variable forms a column
| 
| 2) Each observation forms a row
| 
| 3) Each type of observational unit forms a table

  |=====                                                      |   9%

| Any dataset that doesn't satisfy these conditions is considered
| 'messy' data. Therefore, all of the following are characteristics
| of messy data, EXCEPT...

1: Column headers are values, not variable names
2: Variables are stored in both rows and columns
3: A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables
4: Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table
5: Multiple variables are stored in one column
6: Every column contains a different variable

  |======                                                     |  11%

| The incorrect answers to the previous question are the most common
| symptoms of messy data. Let's work through a simple example of
| each of these five cases, then tidy some real data.

...

  |========                                                   |  13%

| The first problem is when you have column headers that are values,
| not variable names. I've created a simple dataset called
| 'students' that demonstrates this scenario. Type students to take
| a look.

> students
  grade male female
1     A    1      5
2     B    5      0
3     C    5      2
4     D    5      5
5     E    7      4

| Nice work!

  |=========                                                  |  15%

| The first column represents each of five possible grades that
| students could receive for a particular class. The second and
| third columns give the number of male and female students,
| respectively, that received each grade.

...

  |==========                                                 |  16%

| This dataset actually has three variables: grade, sex, and count.
| The first variable, grade, is already a column, so that should
| remain as it is. The second variable, sex, is captured by the
| second and third column headings. The third variable, count, is
| the number of students for each combination of grade and sex.

...

  |===========                                                |  18%

| To tidy the students data, we need to have one column for each of
| these three variables. We'll use the gather() function from tidyr
| to accomplish this. Pull up the documentation for this function
| with ?gather.

> ?gather

| You are really on a roll!

  |============                                               |  20%

| Using the help file as a guide, call gather() with the following
| arguments (in order): students, sex, count, -grade. Note the minus
| sign before grade, which says we want to gather all columns EXCEPT
| grade.

> gather(students, sex, count, -grade)
   grade    sex count
1      A   male     1
2      B   male     5
3      C   male     5
4      D   male     5
5      E   male     7
6      A female     5
7      B female     0
8      C female     2
9      D female     5
10     E female     4

| You got it!

  |=============                                              |  22%

| Each row of the data now represents exactly one observation,
| characterized by a unique combination of the grade and sex
| variables. Each of our variables (grade, sex, and count) occupies
| exactly one column. That's tidy data!

...

  |==============                                             |  24%

| It's important to understand what each argument to gather() means.
| The data argument, students, gives the name of the original
| dataset. The key and value arguments -- sex and count,
| respectively -- give the column names for our tidy dataset. The
| final argument, -grade, says that we want to gather all columns
| EXCEPT the grade column (since grade is already a proper column
| variable.)

...

  |===============                                            |  25%

| The second messy data case we'll look at is when multiple
| variables are stored in one column. Type students2 to see an
| example of this.

> students2
  grade male_1 female_1 male_2 female_2
1     A      3        4      3        4
2     B      6        4      3        5
3     C      7        4      3        8
4     D      4        0      8        1
5     E      1        1      2        7

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |================                                           |  27%

| This dataset is similar to the first, except now there are two
| separate classes, 1 and 2, and we have total counts for each sex
| within each class. students2 suffers from the same messy data
| problem of having column headers that are values (male_1,
| female_1, etc.) and not variable names (sex, class, and count).

...

  |=================                                          |  29%

| However, it also has multiple variables stored in each column (sex
| and class), which is another common symptom of messy data. Tidying
| this dataset will be a two step process.

...

  |==================                                         |  31%

| Let's start by using gather() to stack the columns of students2,
| like we just did with students. This time, name the 'key' column
| sex_class and the 'value' column count. Save the result to a new
| variable called res. Consult ?gather again if you need help.

> res <- gather(students2, sex_class, count, -grade)

| You're the best!

  |===================                                        |  33%

| Print res to the console to see what we accomplished.

> res
   grade sex_class count
1      A    male_1     3
2      B    male_1     6
3      C    male_1     7
4      D    male_1     4
5      E    male_1     1
6      A  female_1     4
7      B  female_1     4
8      C  female_1     4
9      D  female_1     0
10     E  female_1     1
11     A    male_2     3
12     B    male_2     3
13     C    male_2     3
14     D    male_2     8
15     E    male_2     2
16     A  female_2     4
17     B  female_2     5
18     C  female_2     8
19     D  female_2     1
20     E  female_2     7

| Excellent work!

  |====================                                       |  35%

| That got us half way to tidy data, but we still have two different
| variables, sex and class, stored together in the sex_class column.
| tidyr offers a convenient separate() function for the purpose of
| separating one column into multiple columns. Pull up the help file
| for separate() now.

> ?separate

| You are amazing!

  |=====================                                      |  36%

| Call separate() on res to split the sex_class column into sex and
| class. You only need to specify the first three arguments: data =
| res, col = sex_class, into = c("sex", "class"). You don't have to
| provide the argument names as long as they are in the correct
| order.

> separate(res, sex_class, c("sex", "class"))
   grade    sex class count
1      A   male     1     3
2      B   male     1     6
3      C   male     1     7
4      D   male     1     4
5      E   male     1     1
6      A female     1     4
7      B female     1     4
8      C female     1     4
9      D female     1     0
10     E female     1     1
11     A   male     2     3
12     B   male     2     3
13     C   male     2     3
14     D   male     2     8
15     E   male     2     2
16     A female     2     4
17     B female     2     5
18     C female     2     8
19     D female     2     1
20     E female     2     7

| Keep up the great work!

  |=======================                                    |  38%

| Conveniently, separate() was able to figure out on its own how to
| separate the sex_class column. Unless you request otherwise with
| the 'sep' argument, it splits on non-alphanumeric values. In other
| words, it assumes that the values are separated by something other
| than a letter or number (in this case, an underscore.)

...

  |========================                                   |  40%

| Tidying students2 required both gather() and separate(), causing
| us to save an intermediate result (res). However, just like with
| dplyr, you can use the %>% operator to chain multiple function
| calls together.

| The first variable, name, is already a column and should remain as

| At first glance, there doesn't seem to be much of a problem with

| observations. However, notice that each id, name, and sex is
| repeated twice, which seems quite redundant. This is a hint that
| our data contains multiple observational units in a single table.

| Our solution will be to break students4 into two separate tables
| -- one containing basic student information (id, name, and sex)
| and the other containing grades (id, class, midterm, final).
| 
| Edit the R script, save it, then type submit() when you are ready.
| Type reset() to reset the script to its original state.

| It's important to note that we left the id column in both tables.
| In the world of relational databases, 'id' is called our 'primary
| key' since it allows us to connect each student listed in
| student_info with their grades listed in gradebook. Without a
| unique identifier, we might not know how the tables are related.
| (In this case, we could have also used the name variable, since
| each student happens to have a unique name.)

| The fifth and final messy data scenario that we'll address is when
| a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. It's the

  |============================================               |  75%

| To illustrate this, we've created two datasets, passed and failed.
| Take a look at passed now.

> passed
   name class final
1 Brian     1     B
2 Roger     2     A

| Teachers decided to only take into consideration final exam grades
| in determining whether students passed or failed each class. As
| you may have inferred from the data, students passed a class if
| they received a final exam grade of A or B and failed otherwise.

...

  |===============================================            |  80%

| The name of each dataset actually represents the value of a new
| variable that we will call 'status'. Before joining the two tables
| together, we'll add a new column to each containing this
| information so that it's not lost when we put everything together.

...

  |================================================           |  82%

| Use dplyr's mutate() to add a new column to the passed table. The
| column should be called status and the value, "passed" (a
| character string), should be the same for all students.
| 'Overwrite' the current version of passed with the new one.

> passed <- passed %>% mutate(status = "passed")

| You got it!

  |=================================================          |  84%

| Now, do the same for the failed table, except the status column
| should have the value "failed" for all students.

> failed <- failed %>% mutate(status = "failed")

| You are doing so well!

  |==================================================         |  85%

| Now, pass as arguments the passed and failed tables (in order) to
| the dplyr function bind_rows(), which will join them together into
| a single unit. Check ?bind_rows if you need help.
| 
| Note: bind_rows() is only available in dplyr 0.4.0 or later. If
| you have an older version of dplyr, please quit the lesson, update
| dplyr, then restart the lesson where you left off. If you're not
| sure what version of dplyr you have, type packageVersion('dplyr').

> bind_rows(passed, failed)
    name class final status
1  Brian     1     B passed
2  Roger     2     A passed
3  Roger     5     A passed
4  Karen     4     A passed
5  Brian     5     C failed
6  Sally     1     C failed
7  Sally     3     C failed
8   Jeff     2     E failed
9   Jeff     4     C failed

| Of course, we could arrange the rows however we wish at this
| point, but the important thing is that each row is an observation,
| each column is a variable, and the table contains a single
| observational unit. Thus, the data are tidy.

| The SAT is a popular college-readiness exam in the United States
| that consists of three sections: critical reading, mathematics,
| and writing. Students can earn up to 800 points on each section.
| This dataset presents the total number of students, for each
| combination of exam section and sex, within each of six score
| ranges. It comes from the 'Total Group Report 2013', which can be
| found here:
